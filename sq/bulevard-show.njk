<h1>The Bulevard show</h1>
<h2> 23rd September 2022</h2>

<p>The Bulevard Show is a yearly celebration happening on the 23rd of September which invites colleagues, neighbors, friends and passers-by to reconsider the approach to space, narratives and performativity. It is narrated through the research of Bulevard Art and Media Institute and it happens within the architecture of Destil, a project that combines architecture, cultural initiatives and sustainable economy as a response to the fast transformation of the city.</p>
<br />
<h3 class="centered">Curatorial text</h3>
<p>It was 1941 when “As the old woman told me” was published in Tirana. Musine Kokalari wrote it three years prior, only a year after she moved to Rome to study at La Sapienza.</p>
<p>At Bulevard six young actors have been rehearsing Musine’s text every day for the past two months. “It wasn’t written for dramaturgy, I had to transform it for the actors” says Anila, who admits her desire to just talk in Tosk, a dialect she has explored through this work. Musine was born in Turkey where she lived with her family until she was 3 years old, when she went back to her city of origins: Gjirokastra, situated to the south of the river Shkumbin, which cuts the Albanian language into Geg (to the north) and Tosk. And the latter is the dialect that nourished Musine with the elements that she brings into her writing. “It is easier to gossip in Tosk” all the actors seem to agree during a muhabbet (dialogue) while rehearsing. And they continue: “Musine only portrayed reality, what she saw, the women gossiping in the streets”. However, it requires an amount of patience, empathy and skills to portray the complexity of what seems as simple as the reality of the everyday...I think. I then turn to Anila who is feeling the responsibility of staging Musine for the first time. She is anxious about this attempt, and she wants to respect the truth that the writer has brought forward by voicing herself both in literature and in her short political career for which she was punished and died in isolation in 1983...</p>
<p>Abrupt change. It is pitch dark. The actors are traveling to the north of the river where Geg is the vessel of everyday dialogue. They grab the text that Anila has prepared for them: Pishtaret e Nates (Lanterns in the Night), by Martin Camaj. “He had grammatical rules also for Geg” the actors tell me while trying to work out the meanings of particular words. With Martin, the language of the rule is to be found in the psychology of the mountain, which includes the rough nature that is made of, and the spirits inhabiting the fears and hopes of the people. “The part that I have extracted is a love story,” says Anila. One that comes, between two people, after the institution of marriage, paradoxically, one would think.</p>
<p>It was 1941 when “As the old woman told me” was published in Tirana. Musine “The couple fell in love because of gossip,” commented the actors. There is an abiding feeling of loneliness in the text. But the mountain walker is never alone, as Martin teaches us, because if the night makes everything possible, we can imagine going through conflicts together... Yes, even through the help of cheeky fairies, if we allow ourselves to believe that.</p>
<p>Neon lights. From the peak of the dark mountain, we travel through a building cared for by Destil, in Tirana. Entering its underground level, we find ourselves in Bulevard Art and Media Institute, where we are working. We are surrounded by the communist newspapers that were produced where we are now seated, and that the National State Archive gave us for the last Bulevard Show: the front cover pages of Gazeta Bashkimi for the 23 of September, every year from 1945 until ‘91. Surrounding the newspaper are the Bulevard Gossips, our counter-narrative exploring truth and lies, or the archive of the living stories that were always there, at least since the 30s when the fascists were building the boulevard, pretending that the city was not present. From among the Bulevard Gossips Anila, chose to develop one: “The Labyrinth '', the one about the archivist. “I can only follow one element, not more,” Anila explains to me. “It was hard to translate it into literary albanian”...She admits.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine....” and she continues describing her recent dramaturgical adventure into the Albanian language.</p>
<p>All of a sudden we can hear the river stones shaping the Albanian dialects. An old woman from Gjirokastra by mistake sells her stool to a merchant traveling from the north. She spoke Tosk, he spoke Geg. Now instead of a stool she has a lantern. It’s dark, the sound of the river disappears. To us she seems lost, like the archivist in the labyrinth. But .”...shhht, listen...”, say the actors “...She is gossiping about us!...”.</p>
