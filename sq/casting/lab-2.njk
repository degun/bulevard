<p>Every day, from 9:30 until 14:00 around the boulevard there is a group of young promising actors led by a funnambolist. Every day they have been asking themselves: how do you imagine yourself as a grandmother? Where do you find the right language to gossip better? Which are the stories that we refuse to rehearse? And what about those that we might decide to trust and perform all-over again. Every day. Repeating. Failing. Repeating. Another day. Move around the building. Voice up. Voice down. The funambulist teaches them to jump from the terrace to the underground and from the underground to the ruins. We are discussing it because in someoneâ€™s hometown the muhabbet does not start this way. The text is created collectively, and it takes from one story, one only, and we want to archive it, but the archivist is lost in a labirinth! Now a pause, around the Bulevard, because a stranger might join in and inspire another question, such as, for instance: Do you believe in witches? Hajde! Back to the terrace then!</p>
