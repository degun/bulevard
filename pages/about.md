# Who are we?

Bulevard Art and Media Institute combines artistic methodology with media as a way to contextualize archival narratives.

Bulevardâ€™s spaces are located in the underground lever of the former Gazeta Bashkimi building -  overlooking Bulevard Zogu I in Tirana.

Bulevard works with the storytelling of the intimate and its position within the collective. Its program compromises exhibitions, laboratories, conversations and celebratory events, which are narrated through the editorial processes of Gossips, Diaries and Letters.
