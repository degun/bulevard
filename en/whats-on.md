Bulevard is pleased to present the second year of Diaries: a quest exploring collective artistic production in Albania, from the 1990s across the first decade of the 2000s, through the lens of Lindart, the first and only association of women artists in Albania.  
  
The first Diaries exhibition in 2022 was conceived as the beginning of a process, rather than an end result. Now Bulevard is opening the second Diaries “entry” by combining an exhibition with a symposium. Both iterations interweave documentation and storytelling, where reimagined art historical narratives, engaged artistic practice, friendship, and mutual support become visible across and within political and social borders.  
  
The exhibition is comprised of four parts. The first section consists of filmic documentation of five encounters, starting with the initial reunion of Lindart artists in May 2022. After Eleni Laperi, the president of Lindart, retrieved the long-forgotten archive of the association, other artists in the collective were invited to share their stories. Around a table at the Academy of Others studio in Tirana, they asked themselves: How and what do we decide what to keep in the archive? The response was activated by revisiting documents and notes, a process through which many more conversations and convivial meals took place. Later, four artists who had worked or been in dialogue with the association were invited to return to Albania and bring their own archival material. Tanja Ostojić worked with Lindart in 2001, as part of the exhibition _Dare to Be Different_ in Fier, which showcased thirty women artists from Eastern Europe, and again in 2002 when she conducted a ten-day workshop, _Confrontations_. The same year, Lindart invited Marina Gržinić to present her research (later published as “Encountering the Balkans: The Radicalization of Positioning”). In 1993, as part of a summer school in Tirana, Riet van der Linden introduced the work of the Amsterdam-based Dutch women’s art association Stichting Vrouwen in de Beeldende Kunst, which she was part of. Lala Meredith-Vula came to Tirana in 1994 to participate in an exhibition at the National Gallery, curated by Lumturi Blloshmi, who invited Meredith-Vula to take part at a Lindart meal at her house, where the recently founded collective would meet.  
  
In the Bulevard Laboratory, visitors are welcomed by the Diaries photo album, through which they can follow the ongoing archival process of the Diaries and further engage with it by leaving thoughts and notes.  
  
In the Library, visitors can access books collected since the opening of the Diaries in 2022, which focus on feminism as a space of translation. Here, too, a table showcases paper collages of the ongoing interpretation work that Academy of Others is developing with Andreja Dugandžić through the book _AFŽ: Background Work, 1942–1945_ and the archive of the Antifascist Struggle of Women of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.  
  
In the Pocket Cinema, a film work by Marina Gržinić, Aina Šmid, and Zvonka T. Simčič, as well as a work by Silvi Naçi, open up the possibility of “creating community by undoing heteronormative language.”  
  
For this Diaries entry, people and projects have been brought together to help further contextualize, understand, and critically assess the ways that we are engaging the archive and positioning ourselves and our work within it. The symposium is structured via three lenses: the independent, the institutional (specifically within Albania and Kosovo), and the critical (perspectives attentive to the politics of memory and its relation to historical narratives in postsocialist Balkan societies).  
  
Revisiting practices like Lindart, which from a feminist perspective has been marginalized from patriarchal narratives of art history, offer a powerful entry point into the past and future of collective and solidarity-based approaches, opening up a learning process that occurs through and with the other.  
  
The archive of Diaries and Lindart & the Albanian Women Artists Association is being constructed as an open-access platform, a commons that can support, by connecting with others, the possibility of further collective efforts. In this way, the archive can become a place to critically contextualize previous encounters, and reflect on the economy that continues to produce them today.
